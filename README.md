# Book-recommendation-system
Unsupervised Machine learning based recommendation system 

## problem Statement


Recommendation
systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of
income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from
competitors. The main objective is to create a book recommendation system for
users

## Approaches

   1. Understanding Datasets
   2. Understanding The Business Problem
   3. Data cleaning and preprocessing
   4. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   5. MODELING OF RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS

## Results

A book recommendation system can be a valuable tool for businesses that sell or
lend books. It can help to increase sales and customer satisfaction, improve the user
experience, and provide a competitive advantage. However, implementing a
recommendation system can be a challenging process, as it requires the gathering
and analysis of a large dataset and the development of machine learning
algorithms. It is also important to consider issues such as the cold start problem
and user privacy when designing the system.
Overall, a book recommendation system can provide many benefits to businesses,
but it is important to carefully plan and execute the project in order to achieve the
desired results.



## Challenges

Handling of sparsity was a major challenge as well since the user interactions were not present
for the majority of the books.
Understanding the metric for evaluation was a challenge as well.
Since the data consisted of text data, data cleaning was a major challenge
Decision making on missing value imputations and outlier treatment was quite challenging as
well.

## Future Scopes

Given more information regarding the books dataset, namely features like Genre, Description
etc., we could implement a content-filtering based recommendation system and compare the
results with the existing collaborative-filtering based system.
We would like to explore various clustering approaches for clustering the users based on Age,
Location etc., and then implement voting algorithms to recommend items to the user depending
on the cluster into which it belongs.
